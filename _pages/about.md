My research focuses on two main areas: (1) **multi-modal foundation models**, with an emphasis on perceiving, understanding, modeling, and replicating complex multi-sensory signals such as visual, acoustic, tactile, and EEG data; and (2) **generative modeling of the physical world**, with the goal of synthesizing scalable and reliable digital assets that reproduce real-world entities. My research is at the intersection of computer vision and real-world applications, striving to pioneer transformative technologies for social benefit. I actively serve as an Area Chair for leading conferences in computer vision and machine learning, including CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML and AAAI. I am also an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Image Processing and  Neural Networks.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D.(2020) from the [IBUG](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/home) group under the supervision of Prof. [Stefanos Zafeiriou](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/szafeiri/). My doctoral research focused on deep face analysis and modeling, encompassing efficient geometry estimation, robust feature embedding, and photorealistic texture modeling. I developed algorithms and systems ([InsightFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/)) to capture, represent, and synthesize diverse human faces with high efficiency, robustness, and fidelity. Additionally, I worked in the field of visual representation learning and won many visual perception challenges (e.g., [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/challenges/beyond_ilsvrc) and [ActivityNet](http://activity-net.org/challenges/2017/program.html)) in the past years.
